      <p class="title">About Me</p>
      <p>
        I have over 6 years of experience as a software engineer, and have worked at both
        small startups and large organizations. While I'm a proficient full-stack developer,
        my expertise is in building scalable backend services (API services, stream processing,
        and async mechanisms).

        I love building things. While hard engineering problems are often intrinsically fun to tackle,
        I'm most attracted to solving real customer problems with a business justification. I'm looking
        for a senior individual contributor role where I can take on on collaborative team leadership
        responsibilites, and gain experience with architecture and project management.

          <p><span>Open Gidget:</span> OpenGidget is an open-source fork of Raspbian Linux that makes
            it easier to auto-provision a headless Raspberry PI, get it onto your WiFi network, and
            deploy simple Python and Ruby scripts that run at startup - all without needing to plug
            in a keyboard/monitor.
          </p>

          <p><span>Lorem ipsum:</span> Presented research and proof-of-concept to convince team to
            move from Hadoop MR to Spark; reduced nodes by 60% and ran 5-8x faster.

          <p><span>Lorem ipsum:</span> Automated test automation in ramp-up to large data center
            migration, saving hundreds of developer hours. Presented "Understanding the GIL to
            Prevent Race Conditions" at RubyConf 2016. Awarded patent for novel approach to item
            normalization in 3rd party catalog data feeds.
